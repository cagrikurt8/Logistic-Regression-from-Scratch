# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
An implementation of logistic regression with MSE and Log-loss

It contains a comparison of mse, log-loss and scikit-learn's logistic regression models' accuracy scores. For final output, it gives the answers to the sample questions above according to the graph.

1. What is the minimum MSE value for the first epoch?
2. What is the minimum MSE value for the last epoch?
3. What is the maximum Log-loss value for the first epoch?
4. What is the maximum Log-loss value for the last epoch?
5. Has the range of the MSE values expanded or narrowed? (expanded/narrowed)
6. Has the range of the Log-loss values expanded or narrowed? (expanded/narrowed)

It is a really instructive project that contains various data science topics and models such as MSE, Log-loss, logistic regression, train_test_split, standard scaler and accuracy_score.
